# battleship
Mini side project of the classic board game

This single-page application (SPA) uses only html, css and js.

Load up index.html to play.

For the rules, see:
https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/battleship.pdf

It is to be played locally / hot seat.

During certain circumstances, the ship locations / layout can break due to grid css under 400px width.

Using the DOM to cheat is possible.  Could have stored/removed the opponent's boards' innerHTML between each round to avoid this, decided I wasn't going to code around cheaters of a friendly board game.
